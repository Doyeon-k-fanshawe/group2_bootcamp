            <h3>Evan Hansen</h3>
            <p>Evan is the creative director here at Apeiron. Founding the company in 2022, he stepped down in 2022 to pursue more involved projects with clients. He's driven by a sense of accomplishment that only comes from completing projects. Nothing is better to him that seeing a carefully made plan come to fruition. That being said, he doesn't always have the energy to make grand schemes so occationally he'll settle for going with the flow. An avid learner and a true troubleshooter, he makes sure he can sleep well at night knowing your job is done and was done well.</p>
